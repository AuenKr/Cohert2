#### Myths about communication

1. Even person with good english and communicator, you can still be absolute idot
   eg: What does the nation want to know?? => Content is shit

2. Good English != Good Communication
   eg: Due to society => as person speak in english will consider as intelligent

#### Why People fear stage fear??

1. stage fear is the 2nd most fear after death

2. Why ?
   a. Fear of judgement
   b. Lack of confidence
   c. Insecurities

> All this reason are shit : Task

Task :
a. Choose your fav subject
b. Choose your fav topic
c. Speak for 5 mins in front of the camera

> Observation
> a. 1 min => speak very well
> b. 2 min => feeling of not knowing the topic well
> c. 3 min => speaking nothing interesting
> d. 4 min => clueless about what to speak

> In that alone room all why reason are not valid? Still you will not speak what?

3. The real Reason was :

> You do not have enough knowledge to speak for 5 mins about your fav subject

> With lack of content you will never able to deliver a speech

#### How Communication happen and diff factor ?

Information -> Understanding -> Communication

If (Not Communication) => lack of Understanding or lack of Information

With lack of content you will never able to deliver a good speech

#### How to practice communication ?

> Exercise 1 :

Summary :

    Repeat : write -> speak -> modify

1. Read the content (Accumulating information)

2. Understand the content if not then re-read the content (Accumulating information better)

3. Write what you understood in paper in your own words without re-referring to the article (Articulation)

4. Refer the article and see what things you are missing. Read it and re-write it again from top to bottom?
   Repeat the process while you get most of the things right

5. Explain what you have written to the camera as if camera is a person itself

Then show it to anyone who-ever you are comfortable with.
And ask "Did they understood what I have spoke in the video"

If Yes : Could you explain whatever I explained in the video ?
`
If Not then ask why ?

Get feedback on what they did not get and work on it.

Solve the issue and re-shoot the video and ask them again?

`

Do this process of 30 days daily new video

##### NOTE ( What not to do? )

1. Do not practice in front of the mirror ( Only for improving the body language, cannot be done simultaneously )

2. Do not practice with anything that will diverge your focus on two things at once. (Use back camera)
   While speaking my focus should be on one thing that is content

3. Never copy/paste content ( good for writing but not for speaking ) because it will make things difficult.

4. Good written material != good speaking material

Always speak your content out before finalising into bits and pieces

#### Exercise for Week 1 Sol

Exercise 1: Present the below story in your own world and make a video.

```text
U are on-boarding manager for post-recruitment process for next 6 week. Ur job is to make familiar with corporate culture so that u get used to environment.I am not giving lecture after lecture. Just giving the 3 story and hope u will derived enough insights that is required in the survive the corporate culture. So here it goes
 a. Crow story
    Once upon a time there was a crow which was sitting on top of tree during absolutely nothing. That's why a rabbit comes and after running all around when he sees the crow, he is absolute fascinated by the idea of sitting and doing nothing.
    That's when rabbit ask the crow can I also sit and do nothing, the crow's say "Sure, bro why not!". The rabbit sit near beneath the tree. Immediately a fox nearby sees the rabbit and eats the rabbit.

Management Moral : To be sitting and doing nothing, u need to be sitting really really at the top, so until then it's better to keep your ash working.

 b. Turkey and Bull
Once upon a time a Turkey is be friend of a bull. Turkey was disappointed by something or other. So the bull ask why are you disappointed? Turkey reply you know I want to be climb the top of the tree but I don't have the energy. Bull said, You know bro this human said that my dung has lot of energy. Why not you get my dung and try to climb. You may get enough energy to climb the tree.
 Somehow turkey try this idea and was able to reach the first branch of the tree. Then next day he again peek on the dung of bull and reach second branch of tree. Over the course of week doing this repeatedly he was mange to the top of the tree.
  And that's where the farmer spotted the turkey and shoot it done and makes great dinner with Turkey meat.

Management Moral : Bullshit might able to get you to the top but it's not enough to keep it there.

  c. Bird in cold wind
Once the Bird was trying to move from one place to other in winter season. And that night bird got froze and fell to the ground.
  That's when a crow comes by and dung on the frozen bird. And because the dung was warm the ice start melting. Delighted by the warm feeling, the bird start singing. And that's when cat nearby heard his song, remove the dung and eat her.

Moral:
  * Not every one who shits on you is your enemy.
  * Not every one who remove the shits from you is your friend.
  * When you are in shit, better keep your mouth shut.
```

Observation:

> Speaking in public is completing different from speaking in front of camera.

Eg: He takes 2 month to shoot a good 3 min video, even he was a good public speaker.

> After practicing for more than 6 month, things got better and he was able to make instagram video.
> Practice for 6 month to master anything.

> Not compare yourself with other in that time frame. First you have to give your enough time to practice.

### Week 2

> The Science of Storytelling.

#### Why?

1. It is the `greatest weapon of human kind`

2. All great people who brings revolution to human history were none other than great story teller.
   eg: Steve Jobs in Technology, Hitler in dark history, Martin King Jr in American history.

#### Science behind this??

> Biological reason

> Due to `Pre-frontal Cortex` in brain develop in brain
> It's put you in situation where you are not in but actually react that you are experiencing that situation.

> Eg: While watching movie, you get emotional, patriarchal due to sceen in the movie.

> `Story telling` gives power to influence the `pre-frontal cortex` of brain.
> Due to which people get connected with you and started trusting you.

#### How brand Use this to print tons of money

##### Coco Cola Company

> What is Coco Cola?
> Nothing but a sugar brand.

> What people believe about Coco cola?
> Coco Cola company sells their product as they are selling the happiness. And hence people related as they but their product they are consuming happiness.

> Case study for finding difference bw Coco Cola and Pepsi ?
> a. compare coco and pepsi without label => no diff bw drink.
> b. Now with label => People believe coco cola was more tasty
> c. Now label swap => People said pepsi with label of Coca was more tasty.

> It was not about taste, recipe but about the brand of Coca Cola.
> As people believe in that prev story that mentioned.
> Coco Cola spend billions on marking to make image of buying happiness equivalent to buying their product.

> In 2000s, According to India context, Coco cola company spend marketing by cricket.
> As India is such a diverse country with large about on religion and culture present its not possible for them to make advertisement for each.
> So they focus on place like cricket which unit the whole country.
> Hire Sachin Tendulkar as brand ambassador and make add as they are selling happiness.

###### Lessons from Coco Cola

1. Product Coco Cola comes at last 3 sec, because Coco Cola focus on resonating its image as making happiness.

`Resonance is a golden assest`

2. `Good brands sell product, Great brands sell you an emotional`

##### Cadbury way of Storytelling

> Product: **Cadbury Celebration**

> Just before Diwali, every store flooded with Cadbury Celebration

> Niche Study: Who is my audience ?
> In Raksha Bandhan: Brother -> To make sister happy
> Problem: Brother get confuse what to gift them ?

###### Notice in Cadbury Add

> Sister age is somewhere near when they are getting marriage but bother age keep changing.

#### Note

> `Advertisement` not only launch to drive customer towards the product but, Also to `drive customer away from particular product`.

Example : Add campaign by `Peta Cruelty-Free` driving customer away from certain product i.e [Add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs8yqcrqo1s)

#### Case Study of Hitler Speech

> Given around 8000 speeches

> Speech Resonate with people one

```text
1. Blame your current worse situation to others for the situation you are in. This is natural human tendency.
2. Hitler plays on this, and blame bad situation of Germany beause of Jews people.
3. Compare Jews people with disgusting creature like rats. Why?
Because back then people are shit scare of rats due to plauge created by rats.
4. When Hitler constanly compare Jews with rat, people start looking jews and rat.
5. When Nazis officer were interviewed after war, How the hell they gather the courage of doing such a inhuman act to Jews. They are they believe the are not doing this to human but rat. And by doing this they are serving the greater good( preventing the plauge created by rats ).
```

> Question: Were those people idiots? If Scientist can develop cruel way to kill Jews, then how these brain not able to identify whatever the Hitler was talking is bullshit?
> Ans: `Storytelling of Hitler`.

> Hitler leverage the emotion of disgust in his storytelling.

##### Lessons

1. As audience, `learn to spot propaganda`.
   eg: If some political leader is blaming some community as a reason of your current status.

2. `Never let your insecurities to taken for granted`.

3. `Understand what does your audience care about` and leverage that in your story telling.

### Exercise 2

Pre requisite: Speak properly in front of camera (Speak all three stories properly)

> If you are not able to complete the exercise 1 it will take you much more time.

> Instruction Of Week 2 Exercise

1. Read the case study about `power of collabration and power of teamwork`.

2. Same as prev: Read -> Understand -> write -> present in camera -> show to somebody.

3. Now considering you are keynote speaker and deliver this story in front of entrepreneur (audience) for 5 min, explaining the importance of `imporatnce of teamwork and collaboration`.
   And derive the moral of story as Micheal Jordan quote `Talent will win you game, but intelligence and teamwork wins you campionship`.

`The Red Balloon Challenge`

Read the extract carefully and just like last week, follow the procedure and curate a 5-7 mins speech using the given story.

Scenario:
You are a professional keynote speaker at a Start-up summit / Leadership summit (According to your choice) and you have been asked to signify the power of collaboration.

Hence, use the following content to derive the moral of the story
“Talent might win you games but teamwork and intelligence will win you championships” - Michael Jordan

Question: How would you go about finding ten large red balloons deployed at secret locations throughout the United States?
It was dreamed up by scientists from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a division of the U.S. Department of
Defense tasked with helping America’s military prepare for future technological challenges. The Red Balloon Challenge, which DARPA
announced on October 29, 2009, was designed to mimic real-life dilemmas like terrorism and disease control, and offered a $40,000
prize to the first group to accurately locate all ten balloons. The immensity of the task—ten balloons in 3.1 million square
miles—led some to wonder if DARPA had gone too far. A senior analyst for the National Geospatial␂Intelligence Agency declared it
“impossible.”

Within days of the announcement, hundreds of groups signed up, representing a diverse cross-section of America’s brightest minds:
hackers, social media entrepreneurs, tech companies, and research universities. The vast majority took a logical approach to the
problem: They built tools to attack it. They constructed search engines to analyze satellite photography technology, tapped into
existing social and business networks, launched publicity campaigns, built open-source intelligence software, and nurtured
communities of searchers on social media.

The team from MIT Media Lab, on the other hand, didn’t do any of that stuff because they didn’t find out about the challenge until
four days before launch. A group of students, led by postdoctoral fellow Riley Crane, realized they had no time to assemble a team
or create technology or do anything that resembled an organized approach.

So instead they took a different tack. They built a website that consisted of the following invitation: When you sign up to join
the MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team, you’ll be provided with a personalized invitation link, like http://balloon.mit.edu/
yournamehere

Have all your friends sign up using your personalized invitation. If anyone you invite, or anyone they invite, or anyone they
invite (...and soon) wins money, so will you! We’re giving $2000 per balloon to the first person to send us the correct
coordinates, but that’s not all—we’re also giving $1000 to the person who invited them. Then we’re giving $500 [to] whoever
invited the inviter, and $250 to whoever invited them, and so on...(see how it works).

Compared to the sophisticated tools and technology deployed by other groups, the MIT team’s approach was laughably primitive. They
had no organizational structure or strategy or software, not even a map of the United States to help locate the balloons. This
wasn’t a well-equipped team; it was closer to a hastily scrawled plea shoved into a bottle and lobbed into the ocean of the
Internet: “If you find this, please help!”

On the morning of December 3, two days before the balloon launch, MIT switched on the website. For a few hours, nothing happened.
Then, at 3:42 P.M. on December 3, people began to join. Connections first bloomed out of Boston, then exploded, radiating to
Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Denver, Texas, and far beyond, including Europe. Viewed in time lapse, the
spread of connections resembled the spontaneous assembly of a gigantic nervous system, with hundreds of new people joining the
effort with each passing hour.

At precisely 10:00 A.M. Eastern on December 5, DARPA launched the balloons in secret locations ranging from Union Square in
downtown San Francisco to a baseball field outside Houston, Texas, to a woodland park near Christiana, Delaware. Thousands of
teams swung into action, and the organizers settled in for a long wait: They estimated it would take up to a week for a team to
accurately locate all ten balloons.

Eight hours, fifty-two minutes, and forty-one seconds later, it was over. The MIT team had found all ten balloons and had done so
with the help of 4,665 people—or as DARPA organizer Peter Lee put it, “a huge amount of participation from shockingly little
money.” Their primitive, last-minute, message-in-a␂bottle method had defeated better-equipped attempts, creating a fast, deep wave
of motivated teamwork and cooperation.

The reason was simple. All the other teams used a logical, incentive-based message: Join us on this project, and you might win
money. This signal sounds motivating, but it doesn’t really encourage cooperation—in fact, it does the opposite. If you tell
others about the search, you are slightly reducing your chances of winning prize money. (After all, if others find the balloon and
you don’t, they’ll receive the entire reward.)

These teams were asking for participants’ vulnerability, while remaining invulnerable themselves. The MIT team, on the other hand,
signaled its own vulnerability by promising that everyone connected to finding a red balloon would share in the reward. Then it
provided people with the opportunity to create networks of vulnerability by reaching out to their friends, then asking them to
reach out to their friends.

The team did not dictate what participants should do or how they should do it, or give them specific tasks to complete or
technology to use. It simply gave out the link and let people do with it what they pleased. And what they pleased, it turned out,
was to connect with lots of other people. Each invitation created another vulnerability loop that drove cooperation—Hey, I’m doing
this crazy balloon-hunting project and I need your help.

What made the difference in cooperation, in other words, wasn’t how many people a person reached or how good their balloon-search
technology was— it wasn’t really about a given individual at all. It was rather about how effectively people created relationships
of mutual risk. The Red Balloon Challenge wasn’t even really a technology contest. It was, like all endeavors that seek to create
cooperation, a vulnerability-sharing contest.
