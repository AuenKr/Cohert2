#### Myths about communication

1. Even person with good english and communicator, you can still be absolute idot
eg: What does the nation want to know?? => Content is shit

2. Good English != Good Communication
eg: Due to society => as person speak in english will consider as intelligent

#### Why People fear stage fear??

1. stage fear is the 2nd most fear after death

2. Why ?
    a. Fear of judgement
    b. Lack of confidence
    c. Insecurities

  > All this reason are shit : Task

  Task :
  a. Choose your fav subject
  b. Choose your fav topic
  c. Speak for 5 mins in front of the camera

  > Observation
  a. 1 min => speak very well
  b. 2 min => feeling of not knowing the topic well
  c. 3 min => speaking nothing interesting
  d. 4 min => clueless about what to speak

  > In that alone room all why reason are not valid? Still you will not speak what?

3. The real Reason was :

  > You do not have enough knowledge to speak for 5 mins about your fav subject  

> With lack of content you will never able to deliver a speech

#### How Communication happen and diff factor ?

Information -> Understanding -> Communication

If (Not Communication) => lack of Understanding or lack of Information

With lack of content you will never able to deliver a good speech

#### How to practice communication ?

> Exercise 1 :  

Summary :

    Repeat : write -> speak -> modify

1. Read the content (Accumulating information)

2. Understand the content if not then re-read the content (Accumulating information better)

3. Write what you understood in paper in your own words without re-referring to the article (Articulation)

4. Refer the article and see what things you are missing. Read it and re-write it again from top to bottom?
Repeat the process while you get most of the things right

5. Explain what you have written to the camera as if camera is a person itself

Then show it to anyone who-ever you are comfortable with.
And ask "Did they understood what I have spoke in the video"

If Yes : Could you explain whatever I explained in the video ?
`
If Not then ask why ?

Get feedback on what they did not get and work on it.

Solve the issue and re-shoot the video and ask them again?

`

Do this process of 30 days daily new video

##### NOTE ( What not to do? )

1. Do not practice in front of the mirror ( Only for improving the body language, cannot be done simultaneously )

2. Do not practice with anything that will diverge your focus on two things at once. (Use back camera)
While speaking my focus should be on one thing that is content

3. Never copy/paste content ( good for writing but not for speaking ) because it will make things difficult.

4. Good written material != good speaking material

Always speak your content out before finalising into bits and pieces
